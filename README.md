Our instructions to complete this homework were to create three HTML documents and utilize Bootstrap to build a website layout to house our portfolio. The website template was to contain an About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page. We were to utilize the Bootstrap grid system to give our site a reactive layout. We also needed to create a navigation bar at the top.
